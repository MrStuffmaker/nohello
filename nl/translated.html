Dont type "Hello" in the chat and let the others wait | 

Just ask the question! | 

The same counts for: | 

"Hello, are you around?" | 

"hi mate - quick question." | 

Try this instead | 

"hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?" | 

"Hey there Luca can you please help me with my html code when you got  a sec?" | 

"hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?" |
